{"id":"bd-106","title":"EPIC: Complete Parser for All Mermaid Diagram Types","description":"Expand fm-parser to support ALL 24+ mermaid diagram types that mermaid-js supports. The existing FrankenTUI parser handles ~8 types (flowchart, sequence, class, state, gantt, pie, quadrant, packet). We need to add: ER diagram, git graph, mindmap, timeline, user journey, sankey, C4, kanban, architecture, block diagram, radar chart, XY chart, treemap, requirement diagram, plus the DOT format bridge. Each new diagram type needs: tokenizer rules, AST types in fm-core, parser producing MermaidDiagramIr, and test fixtures. Additionally, implement graceful error recovery so malformed/corrupted input degrades to best-effort rendering rather than failing. This is where we differentiate from mermaid-js by being SMARTER about user intent.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Every capability listed in this epic is delivered completely through child issues; no scope cuts and no loss of planned functionality.\n- Child tasks include comprehensive unit/integration coverage and e2e coverage with detailed logging; test evidence is available and reproducible.\n- Performance, determinism, and reliability expectations for this epic are validated with measurable checks.\n- User-facing behavior is documented (README/docs/config/migration notes) for all newly shipped functionality.\n- Release readiness is proven by passing workspace quality gates and epic-level validation flows end-to-end.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-11T16:30:01.329811699Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-12T01:49:48.500842776Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["epic","parser"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-106","depends_on_id":"bd-3bc.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-12T01:49:48.500804154Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}

Dangling edges (referencing non-existent nodes): auto-create placeholder nodes\n   b. Duplicate node IDs: merge definitions, warn\n   c. Circular subgraph containment: flatten with warning\n   d.

Rank Assignment: Longest-path via Kahn's algorithm with BinaryHeap for deterministic ordering. Budget-capped iterations to handle residual cycles.\n3. Crossing Minimization: Barycenter heuristic with optional sifting. Layer-by-layer refinement with position swaps. Merge-sort inversion counting O(n log n).\n4. Coordinate Assignment: Median refinement with configurable spacing. Label-width-aware node sizing. Class diagram member height expansion.\n5. Post-Processing: Cluster boundary computation with padding. Port resolution and attachment. Edge routing with waypoint generation. Quality scoring.\n\nKey types: LayoutPoint, LayoutRect, LayoutNodeBox, LayoutClusterBox, LayoutEdgePath, LayoutStats, DiagramLayout, LayoutSpacing, LayoutTrace, LayoutStageSnapshot.\nKey functions: layout_diagram(), layout_diagram_traced(), compute_node_sizes().\n\nCRITICAL: Determinism guarantees must be preserved -- identical IR always produces identical layout. No RNG, no float nondeterminism, BinaryHeap<Reverse> for min-first order, deterministic tie-breaking via node ID strings.\n\nDependencies: fm-core only. No rendering dependencies.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- All functionality explicitly described above is implemented fully; no scope reduction, no feature deletions, and no silent behavioral regressions.\n- Code is modular, documented where needed, and integrated with existing crates/interfaces without compatibility shims or duplicated logic.\n- Comprehensive automated tests are added/updated for this issue: focused unit tests + relevant integration coverage for touched behavior and edge cases.\n- End-to-end validation is covered where applicable (CLI and/or WASM path) with detailed structured logging (inputs, detection results, node/edge counts, output sizes, timings, and pass/fail reasons).\n- Diagnostics are actionable: failures/warnings include precise context and suggested remediation.\n- Determinism and stability expectations are verified for affected outputs (layout/render/serialization as applicable).\n- Quality gates pass: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo check --all-targets`, and relevant `cargo test` scope.","status":"in_progress","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-11T16:29:17.962374792Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-12T01:13:35.924945835Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["extraction","layout"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-3bc.3","depends_on_id":"bd-3bc","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-11T16:29:17.962374792Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"bd-3bc.3","depends_on_id":"bd-3bc.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-11T16:29:32.112274197Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}],"comments":[{"id":1,"issue_id":"bd-3bc.3","author":"Dicklesworthstone","text":"Progress update: extracted deterministic fm-layout skeleton with key types (LayoutPoint/LayoutRect/LayoutNodeBox/LayoutClusterBox/LayoutEdgePath/LayoutTrace), staged pipeline APIs (layout_diagram/layout_diagram_traced/compute_node_sizes), and baseline deterministic tests.

{"id":"bd-vb9.1","title":"Implement superior cycle handling in Sugiyama layout","description":"This is THE core differentiator mentioned in the X thread. Mermaid-js handles cycles poorly. Our approach:\n\n1. DETECTION: Tarjan's SCC algorithm to find all strongly connected components. Report cycle count, participants, and nesting depth.\n\n2. MULTI-STRATEGY CYCLE BREAKING (user-configurable):\n   a. GREEDY (current): Source/sink peeling. Fast, good for mostly-DAG graphs.\n   b. DFS-BACK: Depth-first search, reverse back edges. Minimizes reversed edges.\n   c. MINIMUM-FEEDBACK-ARC-SET: Approximation algorithm (NP-hard exact). Finds near-minimal set of edges to reverse. Better aesthetics for heavily cyclic graphs.\n   d. CYCLE-AWARE: Don't break cycles at all -- render them as visible cycles with curved back-edges. This is the 'honest' approach that shows the user their cycles rather than hiding them.\n\n3. BACK-EDGE RENDERING: For reversed edges in GREEDY/DFS/MFAS modes, provide metadata so renderers can draw them distinctly (dashed line, different color, reversed arrowhead) to communicate that these represent cycles.\n\n4. CYCLE CLUSTER COLLAPSE: Option to collapse an entire SCC into a single 'cycle cluster' node that can be expanded. Reduces visual complexity for highly cyclic subgraphs.\n\n5. QUALITY METRICS: Track number of reversed edges, total edge length increase from reversal, visual symmetry of cycle representation. Expose in LayoutStats.\n\nDeterminism: All strategies must be deterministic given identical input. Use stable sorting, break ties by node ID.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- All functionality explicitly described above is implemented fully; no scope reduction, no feature deletions, and no silent behavioral regressions.\n- Code is modular, documented where needed, and integrated with existing crates/interfaces without compatibility shims or duplicated logic.\n- Comprehensive automated tests are added/updated for this issue: focused unit tests + relevant integration coverage for touched behavior and edge cases.\n- End-to-end validation is covered where applicable (CLI and/or WASM path) with detailed structured logging (inputs, detection results, node/edge counts, output sizes, timings, and pass/fail reasons).\n- Diagnostics are actionable: failures/warnings include precise context and suggested remediation.\n- Determinism and stability expectations are verified for affected outputs (layout/render/serialization as applicable).\n- Quality gates pass: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo check --all-targets`, and relevant `cargo test` scope.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-11T16:31:50.539611823Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-12T01:42:15.762883646Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["cycles","differentiator","layout"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-vb9.1","depends_on_id":"bd-3bc.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-11T18:17:35.308823873Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""},{"issue_id":"bd-vb9.1","depends_on_id":"bd-vb9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-11T16:31:50.539611823Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}
